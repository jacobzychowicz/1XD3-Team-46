            <h3>Client Q/A</h3>
            <p><b>1. Do you have a preference on what the project name should be or can we just come up with it?</b><br>"I have no preference, you can come up with it. Preferably something more professional."</p> 
            <p><b>2. Who are the target users of the app?</b><br>"Typically people who are in high school or undergrad who are interested in health sciences or medecine. Most people will probably be on desktop rather than mobile."</p>
            <p><b>3. What static information should be available through the app?</b><br>"The users should be able to see my mission statement, as well as an about me and contact links. There should also be a disclaimer that the website is for educational purposes only, and is in no way medical advice."</p>
            <p><b>4. What kind of design do you want?</b><br>"It should have a navbar, and I like the design of the McMaster Web of Science website. I want it to look professional and clean rather than cluttered."</p>
            <p><b>5. What data needs to be managed and presented to the user?</b><br>"There should be categorized content like my research on neuroscience, fitness and health, and in the future cardiovascular. It should include a timeline for when I did each piece of research. Under each article there should be an area where the user is able to comment on his research. I should be able to edit the articles and the user should only be able to comment."</p>
            <p><b>6. Any interactive elements?</b><br>"There should be hover animations, including when you hover over an image you get a little bit of information about the image. Maybe there could be a little flashcard area at some point in the articles to have the user able to study the content."</p>
